Restrict
========

```javascript
interact(target)
  .draggable({
    restrict: { /* restrict options */ }
  })
  .resizable({
    restrictSize: { /* restrict options */ }
    restrictEdges: { /* restrict options */ }
  });
  .gesturable({
    restrict: { /* restrict options */ }
  });
```

Drags, resizes and gestures can be restricted to a certain areas using one of 3
variations of action restriction:
  - pointer coordinate-based `restrict`
  - element size-based `restrictSize` (resize only)
  - and element edge-based `restrictEdges` (resize only)

restriction
-----------

The `restriction` value specifies the area that the action will be confined to.
The value can be:

 - a rect object with `top`, `left`, `bottom` and `right` or `x`, `y`,
 `width` and `height`,
 - an element whose dimensions will be used as the restriction area,
 - a function which takes `(x, y, element)` and returns a rect or an element
 - one of these strings:
  - `'self'` – restrict to the target element's rect
  - `'parent'` – restrict to the rect of the element's parentNode or
 - a CSS selector string – if one of the parents of the target element matches
 this selector, it's rect will be used as the restriction area.

```javascript
interact(target)
  .draggable({
    restrict: {
      restriction: 'parent',
    }
  })
  .resizable({
    restrictEdges: {
      restriction: {
        left: 0,
        right: 0,
        top: 0,
        bottom: 0
      }
    }
  })
```

elementRect
-----------

With the `restrict` variant, restricting is by default relative to the pointer
coordinates so that the action coordinates, not the element's dimensions, will
be kept within the restriction area. The `elementRect` option changes this so
that the element's edges are considered while dragging.

```javascript
interact(target)
  .draggable({
    restrict: {
      elementRect: { left: 0, right: 0, top: 1, bottom: 1 }
    }
  })
```

For the left and right properties, 0 means the left edge of the element and 1
means the right edge. For top and bottom, 0 means the top edge of the element
and 1 means the bottom.

`{ top: 0.25, left: 0.25, bottom: 0.75, right: 0.75 }` would result in a quarter
of the element being allowed to hang over the restriction edges.

endOnly
-------

```javascript
interact(target)
  .resizable({
    restrictSize: {
      restriction: 'parent',
      endOnly: true,
    }
  })
```

The `endOnly` option is used to restrict just before the end of a drag or
resize.  Before the end event is fired, an extra `<action>move` event is
restricted and fired.

If [inertia](#inertia) is enabled and `endOnly` is set to `true` then the
pointer will follow a curve to the restricted coordinates.
