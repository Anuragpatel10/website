Inertia
=======

```javascript
interact(target)
  .draggable({
    inertia: true
  })
  .resizable({
    inertia: {/* ... */}
  });
```

Inertia allows drag and resize actions to continue after the user releases the
pointer at a fast enough speed. The required launch speed, end speed and
resistance can optionally be configured with the settings below.

If an action ends without inertia but is snapped or restricted with the
`endOnly` option, then the the coordinates are interpolated from the end coords
to the snapped/restricted coords.

resistance
----------

```javascript
interact(target).draggable({
  inertia: {
    resistance: 30,
    minSpeed: 200,
    endSpeed: 100
  }
});
```

The `resistance` is a number greater than zero which sets the rate at which the
action slows down. Higher values slow it down more quickly.

minSpeed
--------

The `minSpeed` is a number which is the minimum launch speed (pixels per
second) that can start inertia.

endSpeed
--------

`endSpeed` is the speed (pixels per second) at which the action is considered to have stopped.

allowResume
-----------

`allowResume` is a `boolean` value which indicates whether the user should be
allowed to resume an action while it is in the inertia phase.

zeroResumeDelta
---------------

`zeroResumeDelta` is a `boolean` which can allow the jump when resuming from
inertia to be ignored in the next move event's `dx`/`dy`. This should be set to
`true` (default) when resizing with inertia or dragging or panning elements
around. For things like drawing on a canvas it should generally be changed to
`false`.

smoothEndDuration
-----------------

```javascript
interact(target).draggable({
  restrict: {
    restriction: parent,
    endOnly: true
  },
  inertia: {
    smoothEndDuration: 0
  });
```

`smoothEndDuration` is the duration (milliseconds) of the interpolated movement
from the actual end coords to the position that is [snapped][snap-endonly] or
[restricted][restrict-endonly] with `endOnly`. Set the value to `0` to disable
end transitions with `endOnly` snap/restrict.
